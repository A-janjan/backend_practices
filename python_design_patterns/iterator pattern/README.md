# Iterator pattern


Iterator is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access
the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in
some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.


It is a good idea to use the iterator pattern whenever you want one or several of the
following behaviors:

+ Make it easy to navigate through a collection
+ Get the next object in the collection at any point
+ Stop when you are done traversing through the collection
