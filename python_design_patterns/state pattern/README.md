Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on maintaining the states of objects that
interact with each other. A very handy tool to model state transitions when solving many
problems is known as a finite-state machine (commonly called a state machine).


What's a state machine? A state machine is an abstract machine that has two key
components, that is, states and transitions. A state is the current (active) status of a system.


the State pattern is nothing more than a state machine
applied to a particular software engineering problem.

The State pattern is applicable to many problems. All the problems that can be solved using
state machines are good use cases for using the State pattern. An example we have already
seen is the process model for an operating/embedded system.


The state design pattern allows for full encapsulation of an unlimited number of states on
a context for easy maintenance and flexibility.
