What is the prototype pattern? The prototype pattern is useful when one needs to create
objects based on an existing object by using a cloning technique.


The prototype design pattern helps us with creating object clones. In its simplest version,
this pattern is just a clone() function that accepts an object as an input parameter and
returns a clone of it. In Python, this can be done using the copy.deepcopy() function.
