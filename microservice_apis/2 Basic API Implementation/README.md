# Basic API Implementation


Marshalling is the process of transforming an in-memory data
structure into a format suitable for storage or transmission over a network. In
the context of web APIs, marshalling refers to the process of transforming an
object into a data structure that can be serialized into a content type of
choice, like XML or JSON, with explicit mappings for the object attributes.
