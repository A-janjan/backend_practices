# The Microservices pattern


We can think of several use cases where microservices offer a clever answer. We can use a
microservices architecture-based design every time we are building an application that has
at least one of the following characteristics:


+ There is a requirement to support different clients, including desktop and mobile

+ There is an API for third parties to consume

+ We have to communicate with other applications using messaging

+ We serve requests by accessing a database, communicating with other systems,
  and returning the right type of response (JSON, XML, HTML or even PDF)

+ There are logical components corresponding to different functional areas of the
application
