The Observer pattern describes a publish-subscribe relationship between a single object, the
publisher, which is also known as the subject or observable, and one or more objects, the
subscribers, also known as observers.


We generally use the Observer pattern when we want to inform/update one or more objects
(observers/subscribers) about a change that happened on a given object
(subject/publisher/observable). The number of observers, as well as who those observers are
may vary and can be changed dynamically.


In this chapter, we covered the Observer design pattern. We use Observer when we want to
be able to inform/notify all stakeholders (an object or a group of objects) when the state of
an object changes. An important feature of Observer is that the number of
subscribers/observers, as well as who the subscribers are, may vary and can be changed at
runtime.
