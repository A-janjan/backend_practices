A structural design pattern proposes a way of composing objects for creating new
functionality.

The adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that helps us make two incompatible
interfaces compatible.


In general, if you want to use an interface that expects function_a(), but you only have
function_b(), you can use an adapter to convert (adapt) function_b() to
function_a().
